This assignment was part of the MSc in Digital Driven Business. Objective of the assigment was to provide an overview of the current gaming landscape. We did this by scraping the metacritic website on details, critic reviews and user reviews of a game, respectively. Additionally, the prices of Bol.com were scraped. As part of the assignment both CSS and Xpath selectors were utilized. Moreover, in sql_details, a working draft scraper is build which directly exports the data to SQLite.
